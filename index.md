I am a second year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ucla.edu/) at UCLA.

I graduated from NJIT in 2016 with BS degrees in [Mathematical Sciences](https://math.njit.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cs.njit.edu/). During my last year of undergrad I interned with [Trillium Labs](https://www.trlm.com/) in equity market analysis and visualization. More recently I interned with the data science team at [Neural Analytics](http://www.neuralanalytics.com/).
